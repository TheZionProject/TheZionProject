## Suggested GitHub Content

In addition to the website codebase, consider posting the following on GitHub to enhance your company's visibility and demonstrate expertise:

* **Project Demos/Code Snippets:**
    * Create separate repositories for simplified versions or demonstrations of your projects (e.g., `Lane_Detection_Demo`, `Med-Bot_API_Example`).
    * Include clear `README.md` files in each project repository explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples.
    * If possible, opensource parts of your projects.
* **Technical Blog Posts/Tutorials:**
    * Write blog posts or tutorials on topics related to your expertise (e.g., "Building a Generative AI Model for Image Synthesis," "Deploying a Machine Learning Model on AWS Lambda").
    * Publish these as Markdown files in a `blog/` or `tutorials/` directory within a dedicated repository.
    * Use GitHub pages to host the blog.
* **Example Datasets:**
    * If you have anonymized or publicly available datasets used in your projects, share them in a dedicated repository.
    * Provide documentation explaining the data's structure and usage.
* **Libraries/Tools:**
    * If you've developed any custom libraries or tools related to your AI/ML work, publish them as open-source projects.
    * Include detailed documentation and examples.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Examples:**
    * Share examples of your IaC configurations for Azure or AWS deployments (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation templates).
    * This demonstrates your experience with cloud deployments.
* **Research Papers/Presentations:**
    * If your company conducts any research or gives presentations at conferences, upload these materials to GitHub.
